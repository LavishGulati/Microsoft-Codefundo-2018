Project Name: 404 Disaster Not Found <br>
Team Name: 404 Brain Not Found <br>
Team Members: Lavish Gulati, Mayank Baranwal, Chirag Gupta <br>
Organization: Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati


## Project Description

Inspired by the recent Kerala floods and the growing number of natural calamities that wreck havoc, we want to use technology to improve the quality of lives of vulnerable citiens in our country. <br>
The various domains of the project are discussed below:

#### 1. Prediction
* To minimize loss of life in a natural disaster (with special emphasis on cyclones) our project aims to use computer vision to detect the formation of cyclones using real time satellite imagery.

#### 2. Prevention
* Once a natural disaster is eminent, our project aims to identify vulnerable areas which at a greatest risk of harm. These include low lying areas and crowded, undrdeveloped areas where evacuation could be difficult.

#### 3. Management
* We will have a platform to co-ordinate rescue efforts and allow disaster vicitims to be heard.
* An additional extension can include a GSM module that can send updates on te disater and tips to affected areas.


## Implementation
The above mentioned domains will be implemented on a web-based platform where the latest prediction alerts, management aspects and prevention techniques will be published.  

* #### Datasets Used
